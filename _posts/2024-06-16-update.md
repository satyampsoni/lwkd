## Developer News

Kubelet node IP address assignment is still "fragile and broken," with [yet another PR this week](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125337).  As such, Antonio Ojea would like people who work on external cloud providers to [weigh in on a long-term solution](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mqdVLQHIYjrzjy8Hq-FMysthHRL7ht0guk2uWI0FxKM/edit#heading=h.97ewrhxwu05m).

SIG-Etcd and SIG-Cluster Lifecycle [have proposed a new Etcd Operator WG](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/L1TgHxIkW_o) in order to create one.

The [call for session proposals](https://www.kubernetes.dev/events/2024/kcsna/schedule/) for the Contributor Summit in Salt Lake City is open.  This includes proposals for presentations, demos, discussions, workshops, and SIG/team meetings; really, anything that should go on the KCS schedule except for the Doc Sprints (which are already there).  [Submit](https://forms.gle/JFPpZ2AnCRRhbwQ6A) before September 15. 

## Release Schedule

**Next Deadline: Docs Deadline for placeholder PRs, June 27th**

Kubernetes [v1.31.0-alpha.2](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/QoRj4c-usUc/m/l36Xh7slCQAJ) is live!

We are in [Enhancements Freeze now](https://groups.google.com/a/kubernetes.io/g/dev/c/38x8HDGzjkA/m/jK_zAwMVAgAJ), and currently have 71 opted-in, 54 tracked, and 7 removed features. If your feature missed the deadline, you need to file an [Exception](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/blob/master/releases/EXCEPTIONS.md).

Patch releases for [1.27.15](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.27.md), [1.28.11](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.28.md), [1.29.6](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.29.md) and [1.30.2](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.30.md) came out last week, being built and pushed using Golang version `1.21.11` and `1.22.4`.

## Featured PRs

#125029 [kubeadm: enable the v1beta4 API](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/pull/125029) 

This PR implements the necessary changes to support the new `v1beta4` kubeadm API in Kubernetes. Key updates include the conversion of `extraArgs` to a list of name/value pairs, the replacement of several configuration fields for improved clarity, and the introduction of the `kubeadm config migrate` command for seamless migration from `v1beta3` to `v1beta4`. While `v1beta3` is deprecated, it remains supported until version `1.34` or later.

## KEP of the Week
### [KEP 4444: Traffic Distribution for Services](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-network/4444-service-traffic-distribution)

This KEP aims to introduce a new field, `trafficDistribution`, to the Kubernetes Service specification. This enhancement is designed to supersede the existing `service.kubernetes.io/topology-mode` annotation and the deprecated `topologyKeys` field to provide a more flexible, user-friendly approach to routing traffic within Kubernetes clusters.

This KEP is tracked for beta release in the upcoming v1.31.
